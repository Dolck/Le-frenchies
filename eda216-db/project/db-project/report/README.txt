Starting the program

The system is delivered as a compressed zip file. To decompress it use the
built-in decompress features in your operating system of choice.

Example:
> unzip krusty.zip

To run the system, Java and Typesafe Reactive Platform is used. If you don’t
have them installed, install them now (https://typesafe.com/get-started). Inside your unzipped folder there is a folder named bin. Go there. To run the program type the following:

(Unix)
> ./db−project

(Windows:)
> db−project.bat

This will output a port in the terminal that you can later be used to run the
system in a browser of your choice.

If running on a local system, open localhost:port in your browser. Otherwise
replace localhost by an ip-address.
